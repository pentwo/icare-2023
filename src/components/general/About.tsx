              At iCare Health Massage and Hypnosis, our mission is to provide holistic,
              compassionate, and evidence-informed care that supports both the body and mind.
              Through remedial massage, clinical hypnosis, and strategic psychotherapy, we aim to
              help each client relieve pain, reduce stress, and feel more connected to
              themselvesâ€”physically, emotionally, and energetically.

            <Text>
              We envision a world where healing is not just about treating symptoms, but about
              empowering individuals to understand and care for their whole selves. At iCare, we
              strive to create a safe, supportive space where people feel seen, heard, and valued.

              Our goal is to normalize integrated care, where mental health and physical health are
              treated with equal respect and attention.
